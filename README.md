# HTML-CSS Projects

## Project 1: Hello World Plus
I developed a basic HTML document to introduce fundamental web development concepts. The page includes a personalized greeting, my chosen editor (Visual Studio Code), and a line from our course textbook. This HTML file was uploaded to a SiteGround hosting account and validated using the W3C HTML Validator to ensure compliance with HTML5 standards.

## Project 2: Clark the Cub
This project required building a semantically structured HTML page to present a Chicago Tribune article about Clark the Cub. The focus was on utilizing semantic HTML tags such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` without any CSS or JavaScript to ensure the content was well-organized and accessible.

## Project 3: Queen Elizabeth
For this assignment, I created a semantic HTML5 resume for Queen Elizabeth I. The resume includes sections for her name, coat of arms, experience, titles, and contact information, each structured with appropriate HTML5 elements. The `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags were used to display images, ensuring a clear and accessible presentation of visual content.

## Project 4: Four Items with a Title
Using HTML and CSS, I constructed a webpage featuring a title and four items arranged in a grid layout. Flexbox was employed for the layout to ensure a responsive design. CSS properties such as `font-family`, `color`, and `border` were used to enhance the visual appeal.

## Project 5: Hero with Three Panels Page
In this project, I built a hero section containing a heading, a wide image, and descriptive text, followed by three content panels. Flexbox was used to achieve a responsive layout, and semantic HTML tags were utilized to ensure the content's structure was meaningful and accessible.

## Project 6: Responsive Limerick
I developed a responsive webpage that features a limerick and an associated image. The layout adapts to different screen sizes using media queries (`@media` breakpoints). CSS techniques such as `object-fit` and `overflow` were used for image manipulation, and pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:active` added interactivity to buttons and links.

## Project 7: Accessibility Audit
An accessibility audit was conducted on a previous project to identify and rectify issues such as ARIA roles, color contrast, and keyboard navigability. Adjustments were made to ensure the project met WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.

## Project 8: Final Project
The final project integrated all skills acquired during the course. I designed and developed a complete website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was validated for HTML and CSS using W3C validators, and an accessibility review was performed to ensure the website adhered to industry standards.
